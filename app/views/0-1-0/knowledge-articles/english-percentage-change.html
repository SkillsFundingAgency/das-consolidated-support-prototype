        <p class="govuk-body">HMRC uses information in your payroll to calculate your English percentage. Your English percentage is based on the proportion of your payroll paid to employees that live in England. Typically, changes to your employeesâ€™ living circumstances may cause your English percentage to change, such as:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>if your existing employees move to England from other parts of the UK, your English percentage may increase</li>
          <li>if you take on new employees who live in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, your English percentage may decrease</li>
          </ul>
