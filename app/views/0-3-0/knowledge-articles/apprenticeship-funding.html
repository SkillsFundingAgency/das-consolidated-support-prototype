        <p class="govuk-body">You can get help from the government to pay for apprenticeship training. The amount you get depends on whether you pay the apprenticeship levy.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">This information is for apprenticeship funding in England. There are different rules for apprentices in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">The apprenticeship levy</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">Employers with an annual pay bill over £3 million must <a href="#">report and pay the apprenticeship levy</a> through the PAYE process.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">The levy only applies to apprenticeships that started after 1 May 2017.</p>


        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Get an apprenticeship service account</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">Levy-paying employers need an apprenticeship service account to:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>get levy funds</li>
          <li>manage apprentices</li>
          <li>pay a training provider</li>
          <li>stop or pause payments to a training provider</li>
            </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">If you do not pay the levy, you can only use an account to get funds from a levy-paying employer.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Use your apprenticeship funds</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">To get funding for an apprenticeship, the apprentice must work in England for at least 50% of their time.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Use your apprenticeship funds (up to the maximum apprenticeship funding band) to pay for an apprentice’s training and assessment.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">You cannot use these funds to pay for:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>wages</li>
          <li>statutory licences to practise</li>
          <li>travel and subsidiary costs</li>
          <li>work placement programmes</li>
          <li>setting up an apprenticeship programme</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="govuk-body">If the training and assessment cost more than the funding band maximum, you must pay the difference with your own funds.</p>
             <p class="govuk-body"><a href="#">View the apprenticeship funding rules</a> to see everything you can use your apprenticeship funds for.</p>

             <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Employees living in England</h3>
             <p class="govuk-body">The funds you get depend on your ‘English percentage’. HMRC work this out using the:</p>
             <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
               <li>number of your employees that live in England</li>
               <li>amount of your pay bill that is paid to them</li>
                 </ul>

                 <p class="govuk-body">You can view your English percentage in your apprenticeship service account.</p>

                 <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">How it works</h3>

                 <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number govuk-!-font-weight-bold">
                   <li><p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Select an apprenticeship type</p>
                     <p class="govuk-body">You can choose a standard or framework apprenticeship.</p>
                     <p class="govuk-body">Standard apprenticeships cover a specific job role and set out the core skills, knowledge and behaviours an apprentice needs.</p>
                     <p class="govuk-body">Framework apprenticeships include work-related vocational and professional qualifications, with workplace and classroom training.</p>
                   </li>
                   <li><p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Choose a training provider</p>
                     <p class="govuk-body"><a href="#">Choose an approved training provider</a> to deliver each of your apprentice’s training.</p>
                   </li>
                   <li><p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Agree the cost</p>
                     <p class="govuk-body">You must agree the total cost for an apprenticeship with your training provider, including the training and assessment. For standard apprenticeships, you must must also include the end-point assessment cost.</p>
                     </li>
                     <li><p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Use your apprenticeship funds</p>
                       <p class="govuk-body">You pay and receive apprenticeship funds when your apprentice starts.. The funds will enter your account after you’ve declared the levy to HMRC each month. They’ll leave your account when you pay for training. </p>
                       </li>
                       </ol>

                       <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Co-investment</h3>
                       <p class="govuk-body">If you don’t have enough funds to make a monthly training payment, you can share the remaining cost with the government. This is called ‘co-investment’.</p>
                       <p class="govuk-body">You’ll need to pay 10% of the amount each month and we’ll pay the rest up to the maximum funding band.</p>
