        <p class="govuk-body">You can view your organisation’s English percentage in your apprenticeship service account.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) work out your English percentage using information from your payroll. This includes the number of your employees that live in England and how much of your payroll is paid to them.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body"><a href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-hmrc">Contact HMRC</a> if you cannot view your English percentage or if it is incorrect.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Changes to your English percentage</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">The English percentage can:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>increase if your employees move to England from other parts of the UK</li>
          <li>decrease if you get new employees who live in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="govuk-body">You must tell HMRC if your employees change their address.</p>

          <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">How we work out your apprenticeship funds</h3>
          <p class="govuk-body">HMRC multiply your declared levy by your English percentage, then we add a 10% government top up.</p>

          <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Example</h3>
          <p class="govuk-body">Company A declares £500,000 apprenticeship levy in the previous tax year. 90 of their 100 employees live in England, so their English percentage is 90%.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">(Declared levy x English percentage) + 10% government top up = apprenticeship funds.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">(£500,000 x 90%) + 10% = £495,000.</p>
